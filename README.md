# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.


Here's a brief of the concepts in the notebook. 



Headings

# for the titles
## for the main headings
### for the subheadings
#### for the smaller subheadings
##### for the italic subheadings
Emphasis

__string__ or **string** for bold text
_string_ or *string*  for italic text
Monospace fonts

A back single quotation mark ` on both sides to get monospace fonts
Line breaks

<br> wherever you want a line break, as the notebook sometimes doesn`t give you the required line break where you want it
Indenting

> to indent the text
>> for further indenting it, and so on
Bullets and numbering

A single dash, i.e. -  followed by two spaces to make bullet points
A number and a dot followed by a space, i.e. 1. to make numbered lists
Colouring

<font color = blue, yellow, red, pink, green, etc.> String </font> to give your font any colour that you want
LaTeX Equations

$ on both the sides of the text to write LaTeX equations
Next, it is also crucial that you know about the various shortcuts while using the Jupyter Notebook. 



Command mode shortcuts

Esc: To go into command mode
Enter: To go back to edit mode
M: To convert a cell to a markdown cell
Y: To convert a cell back to a code cell
A: To insert a new cell above
B: To insert a new cell below
D + D: To delete cell
Z: Undo the last operation
F: To find and replace on your code
Shift + Up/Down: To select multiple cells
Space: Scroll notebook downwards
Shift + Space: Scroll notebook upwards
Edit mode shortcuts

Shift + Enter: To execute the code in the current cell and go to the next cell
Alt + Enter: To execute the code in the current cell and insert new cell below
Shift + Tab: To get a brief documentation of the object that you have just typed in the coding cell
Ctrl + Shift + -: To split the cell at the cursor
Shift + M: To merge selected cells
We have also provided a link to all the shortcuts for Mac users below.

You will slowly get used to effortlessly using these commands to write codes efficiently on your Jupyter Notebook as you move forward, so do not worry about memorising these commands all at once right now. 



Let's answer a couple of questions about what you just learnt before moving forward.

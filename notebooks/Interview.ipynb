    "NoSQL Databases\n",
    "NoSQL (\"Not Only SQL\") is a broad category of database systems that don't use SQL . \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Document databases (**MongoDB**, Couchbase)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores (Redis, **DynamoDB**)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Graph databases (Neo4j, JanusGraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document Databases**\n",
    "Document databases are a specific type of NoSQL database. They **store data in flexible, semi-structured document formats like JSON** or BSON.\n",
    "Key characteristics of document databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data is stored in self-contained documents (similar to JSON objects)\n",
    "* Schema flexibility (documents in the same collection can have different fields)\n",
    "* Hierarchical data structures within documents\n",
    "* Typically high read/write performance\n",
    "* Good for content management, user profiles, and event logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "The main distinction is that all document databases are NoSQL databases, but not all NoSQL databases are document databases.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MongoDB is **both a NoSQL database and a document database**\n",
    "* Redis is a NoSQL database but specifically a key-value store, not a document database\n",
    "* Neo4j is a NoSQL database but specifically a graph database, not a document database\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Each\n",
    "Document databases work well when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need schema flexibility\n",
    "* Your data has a natural document-like structure\n",
    "* You require nested/hierarchical data\n",
    "* You need horizontal scaling for read/write operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Other NoSQL types might be better when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need simple key-value lookups (key-value stores)\n",
    "* You're working with highly connected data (graph databases)\n",
    "*  You need wide-column storage for time-series or large analytical datasets (column-family)\n",
